# Orders Table seller_id Column Fix

## Issue
When accepting a preorder, the system crashed with error:
```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'seller_id' in 'field list'
```

## Root Cause
The `PreorderController::accept()` method was trying to create an order with `seller_id`, but the `orders` table didn't have this column.

**What happened**:
1. We added `seller_id` to `Order` model's `$fillable` array
2. We added a `seller()` relationship to the Order model
3. But we never added the actual column to the database table!

## Solution
Created a migration to add the `seller_id` column to the `orders` table:

```php
Schema::table('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->unsignedBigInteger('seller_id')->nullable()->after('user_id');
    $table->foreign('seller_id')->references('id')->on('users')->onDelete('set null');
    $table->index('seller_id');
});
```

## Migration Details
**File**: `2025_10_22_042438_add_seller_id_to_orders_table.php`

**Changes**:
- Added `seller_id` column (unsigned big integer, nullable)
- Added foreign key constraint to `users` table
- Added index for performance
- Set `onDelete('set null')` for safety (if seller is deleted, order remains)

## Why This is Needed
The `seller_id` column is essential for:
1. ✅ **Preorder to Order Conversion** - When a preorder is accepted, we create an order with the seller's ID
2. ✅ **Order Filtering** - Allows fetching orders by seller
3. ✅ **Seller Relationship** - Enables eager loading seller info with orders
4. ✅ **Buyer Notifications** - Allows showing seller name in buyer's profile notification card

## Database Structure
```
orders table:
- id (primary key)
- user_id (buyer)
- seller_id (seller) ← NEW COLUMN
- address_id
- total
- status
- payment_method
- delivery_address
- delivery_method
- note
- preorder_id
- timestamps
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ Preorder acceptance now works without errors
2. ✅ Orders properly linked to sellers
3. ✅ Can query orders by seller
4. ✅ Buyer notifications show correct seller names
5. ✅ Better data integrity and relationships

## Migration Status
✅ Successfully ran on: 2025-10-22
✅ Execution time: 147.62ms

## Testing
1. ✅ Seller accepts preorder → Order created with seller_id
2. ✅ Order appears in seller's orders tab
3. ✅ Order appears in buyer's orders tab
4. ✅ Seller relationship loads correctly
5. ✅ No database errors
