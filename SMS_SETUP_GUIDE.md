   After:  Name + Email + Phone + Password ‚Üí SMS OTP ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Login
   ```

2. **Endpoints Get Enabled:**
   - `POST /send-phone-verification-code` - Sends OTP
   - `POST /resend-phone-verification-code` - Resends OTP
   - `POST /verify-phone` - Verifies OTP and logs user in

3. **Frontend Works Automatically:**
   - `phone-verification.tsx` already exists and is ready
   - Just change signup flow to navigate to verification screen

## Files to Modify When Enabling

### Backend:
1. `AuthController.php` - Uncomment phone verification methods
2. `SmsService.php` - Configure your chosen provider
3. `.env` - Add SMS provider credentials

### Frontend:
1. `signup.tsx` - Re-enable navigation to phone verification

## Cost Estimate (Monthly)

For **1,000 new users per month**:
- Semaphore: ‚Ç±600/month
- AWS SNS: ‚Ç±360/month  
- Twilio: ‚Ç±3,000/month

**Note:** Only pay for actual SMS sent. No signup = no cost.

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Semaphore SMS when you're ready to launch.**

It's the most cost-effective and reliable for the Philippine market. You can always switch providers later.

---

## Current Workaround

Without SMS verification:
- Users are auto-verified on signup
- `phone_verified_at` is set immediately
- Lower security but no SMS costs
- Good for development/testing phase

When you're ready to add SMS, just follow the steps above! üöÄ
